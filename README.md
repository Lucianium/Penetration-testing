# About me
I started to learn penetration testing 2 years ago. 
It all started from an application that didn't want to reset my password and my burning curiosity that made me learn how websites and programs work.
It was fascinating for me how vulnerable are not only the programs and websites that I use, but the internet as a whole.
From my first lesson that I bought I knew that I found a new passion and a new wish: to make the internet safer.


# Penetration-testing tools
Sometimes, while working with pre-installed tools, errors can occur :(. 
That is why I started building my own tools using the python language (that I also learned by myself), so that I can modify and adapt them according to my own needs.
Here are the tools that I made so far and tools that will be done soon.
